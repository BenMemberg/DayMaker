Write-up:
Indecisive, uncoordinated, and positively noncommittal. These are just a few words that describe the human condition. And so, while “What did you do today?” remains one of the most frequent social queries - “What WILL you do today?” exists as an open-ended antithesis mired in a paradox of choice and possibilities. To combat the infinite (and unnerving) quandary, Ctrl+Alt+Defeat aims to accomplish what any other self-proclaimed computer scientists would do when presented with such a daunting task: "Implement a solution that outsources the open-ended computational problems while considering multiple realistic constraints." 

In broad view, we endeavor to develop an application that utilizes the conversational and discovery capabilities of IBM’s Watson to tailor the events of your personal life with the efficiency, precision, and continuity that comes with the use of an artificial intelligence.
